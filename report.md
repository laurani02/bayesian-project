## Introduction
In this assignment, Bayesian linear regression and Maximum Likelihood Estimaton (MLE) is used to estimate the parameters of a linear model. The assignment consists of two tasks. In the first task, the parameters are estimated using Bayesian linear regression. In the second task, the parameters are estimated using Bayesian linear regression and MLE. The results are compared and discussed.

The goals of the project are to:

- Implement Bayesian linear regression and MLE and analyze the results
- Obtain the posterior probability
- Examine prior and posterior over w
- Examine how adding more data points and varying the noise level affects the models
- Examine how training data and test data are affected by the noise level
- Examine the accuracy of the models
- Use batch learning to estimate the parameters


## Method
For both tasks, Python was used. The code is available in the files [`warmup.ipynb`](https://github.com/laurani02/bayesian-project/blob/main/warmup.ipynb) and ['bayesian.ipynb'](https://github.com/laurani02/bayesian-project/blob/main/bayesian.ipynb). The imported and used libraries are scipy, numpy and matplotlib. While SciPy is used in task 1 for multivariate normal distribution and distance calculation, NumPy and Matplotlib are used in both tasks for calculations and visualisation.
